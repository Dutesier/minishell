# minishell
## Build a simplified version of a shell - (under development :gear:)
### Our shell should:
- [ ] Not interpret unclosed quotes or unspecified special characters like \ or ;.
- [ ] Not use more than one global variable, think about it and be ready to explain why
you do it.
- [x] Show a prompt when waiting for a new command.
- [x] Have a working History.
- [x] Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or by using
relative or absolute path)
- It must implement the builtins:
 - [x]   echo with option -n
 - [ ]   cd with only a relative or absolute path
 - [x]   pwd with no options
 - [x]   export with no options
 - [x]   unset with no options
 - [x]   env with no options or arguments
 - [x]   exit with no options
 - [x]   ’ inhibit all interpretation of a sequence of characters.
 - [ ]   " inhibit all interpretation of a sequence of characters except for $.
- Redirections:
 - [x]   "<" should redirect input.
 - [x]   ">" should redirect output.
 - [x]   “<<” read input from the current source until a line containing only the delimiter is seen. it doesn’t need to update history!
 - [x]   “>>” should redirect output with append mode.
 - Pipes 
   - [x]  "|". The output of each command in the pipeline is connected via a pipe to the
	  input of the next command.
 - [ ]   Environment variables ($ followed by characters) should expand to their values.
 - [ ]   $? should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground
	  pipeline.
 - [x]   ctrl-C ctrl-D ctrl-\ should work like in bash.
- When interactive:
  - [x]   ctrl-C print a new prompt on a newline.
  - [x]   ctrl-D exit the shell.
  - [x]   ctrl-\ do nothing.
 
readline function can produce some leaks, no need to fix this.

For every point, if you have any doubt take bash as a reference.

### File Organization
| Folder      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Parser     | Contains a parser and a lexer that build an Abstract Syntax Tree. The goal is to read the input provided from the user and separate it into actionable commands. Also checks for syntax errors.      |
| Cleaning   | Contains functions to make sure that we go into the next phase (i.e. exiting or new line from user) cleanly. Frees any unnecessary memory. |
| Commands   | Contains functions to replicate bash commands that need to be hardcoded. "cd" is a good example, since we cannot fork and then call chdir because when we exit the fork we'll be left in the same directory. |
| Executing   | Executes commands given by the parser via ```execve```. |
| Redirecting | Takes care of redirecting STDIN and STDOUT when necessary. A good example is that it creates the pipes needed between two processes when givne the ```pipe``` command. |
| Reader | Uses the ```readline``` functions to read a line from the user and create a working history. |
| Utils | Helpful everyday functions. |

### Usage
This project uses a makefile, so to run the program you can compile with ```make``` and then enter ```./minishell```. Minishell usually runs with no arguments but for debugging you can use the ```-debug``` flag (i.e. ```./minishell -debug```).

### Know bugs
-- Tested onLinux --
- [x] Shell hagsout when echo is written without quotes
- [x] echo -n enters in a loop and would not exit
- [x] exit -v enters in a loop and would not exit
- [x] Typing 'echo "ls"' would produce the followint output Expanding quote\n --> ls command
- [ ] Pressing tab without input written would try to autocomplete with the files in the directory
- [x] ls works, ls -l doesn't. Shell enters in a loop and would not exit
- [x] $? works, but it also prints "minishell: command not found:"
- [ ] $? + $? prints minishell: command not found: X
- [ ] After typing something and pressing CTRL + C a couple of times, it keeps saving the typed text in the buffer with the message "minishell: command not found:"
- [ ] After typing the commnad "cat" without arguments the Shell enters in a loop and would not exit
- [ ] export var=x do not export the var
